    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>
      This is my very first attempt at writing a complete HTML document. I'm
      excited to start this journey into web development!
    </p>

    <h3>What You Will Find Here</h3>
    <p>
      On this page, I’ve included several HTML elements such as
      headings,paragraphs, and even a clickable image to showcase what I’ve
      learned so far.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML is the standard markup language used to create webpages. It’s
      simple,powerful, and fun to learn!
    </p>

    <p>
      This paragraph exists to fulfill the requirement of having at least four
      paragraphs — but also to show that I’m serious about learning to code.
